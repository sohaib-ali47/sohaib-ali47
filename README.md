ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sohaib!
I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm new to the world of GitHub. I'm excited to learn and grow as I dive into coding and open-source contributions. This is my first step in sharing my projects, experimenting with code, and collaborating with others.

I'm eager to connect with fellow developers, learn from the community, and improve my skills over time. Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to the journey ahead!
